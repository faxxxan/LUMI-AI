<p align="center">Re-creating Neuro-sama, a soul container of AI waifu / virtual characters to bring them into our world.</p>


> Heavily inspired by [Neuro-sama](https://www.youtube.com/@Neurosama)


> [!NOTE]
>
> We've got a whole dedicated organization [@proj-airi](https://github.com/proj-airi) for all the sub-projects born from Project AIRI. Check it out!

> RAG, memory system, embedded database, icons, Live2D utilities, and more!

Have you dreamed about having a cyber living being (cyber waifu, digital pet) or digital companion that could play with and talk to you?

With the power of modern large language models like [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com) and famous [Claude](https://claude.ai), asking a virtual being to roleplay and chat with us is already easy enough for everyone. Platforms like [Character.ai (a.k.a. c.ai)](https://character.ai) and [JanitorAI](https://janitorai.com/) as well as local playgrounds like [SillyTavern](https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern) are already good-enough solutions for a chat based or visual adventure game like experience.

> But, what about the abilities to play games? And see what you are coding at? Chatting while playing games, watching videos, and is capable of doing many other things.

Perhaps you know [Neuro-sama](https://www.youtube.com/@Neurosama) already. She is currently the best virtual streamer capable of playing games, chatting, and interacting with you and the participants. Some also call this kind of being "digital human." **Sadly, as it's not open sourced, you cannot interact with her after her live streams go offline**.

Therefore, this project, AIRI, offers another possibility here: **let you own your digital life, cyber living, easily, anywhere, anytime**.


## What's So Special About This Project?

Unlike the other AI driven VTuber open source projects, アイリ was built with support of many Web technologies such as [WebGPU](https://www.w3.org/TR/webgpu/), [WebAudio](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API), [Web Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers), [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/), [WebSocket](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket), etc. from the first day.

> [!TIP]
> Worrying about the performance drop since we are using Web related technologies?
>
> Don't worry, while Web browser version is meant to give an insight about how much we can push and do inside browsers, and webviews, we will never fully rely on this, the desktop version of AIRI is capable of using native [NVIDIA CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) and [Apple Metal](https://developer.apple.com/metal/) by default (thanks to HuggingFace & beloved [candle](https://github.com/huggingface/candle) project), without any complex dependency managements, considering the tradeoff, it was partially powered by Web technologies for graphics, layouts, animations, and the WIP plugin systems for everyone to integrate things.

This means that **アイリ is capable of running on modern browsers and devices** and even on mobile devices (already done with PWA support). This brings a lot of possibilities for us (the developers) to build and extend the power of アイリ VTuber to the next level, while still leaving the flexibilities for users to enable features that requires TCP connections or other non-Web technologies such as connecting to a Discord voice channel or playing Minecraft and Factorio with friends.

> [!NOTE]
>
> We are still in the early stage of development where we are seeking out talented developers to join us and help us to make アイリ a reality.
>
> It's ok if you are not familiar with Vue.js, TypeScript, and devtools required for this project, you can join us as an artist, designer, or even help us to launch our first live stream.
>
> Even if you are a big fan of React, Svelte or even Solid, we welcome you. You can open a sub-directory to add features that you want to see in アイリ, or would like to experiment with.
>
> Fields (and related projects) that we are looking for:
>
> - Live2D modeller
> - VRM modeller
> - VRChat avatar designer
> - Computer Vision
> - Reinforcement Learning
> - Speech Recognition
> - Speech Synthesis
> - ONNX Runtime
> - Transformers.js
> - vLLM
> - WebGPU
> - Three.js

## Development

> For detailed instructions to develop this project, follow [CONTRIBUTING.md](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)

> [!NOTE]
> By default, `pnpm dev` will start the development server for the Stage Web (browser version). If you would
> like to try developing the desktop version, please make sure you read [CONTRIBUTING.md](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)
> to setup the environment correctly.

```shell
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```

### Stage Web (Browser Version at [faxxxan/AIRI-AI](https://github.com/faxxxan/AIRI-AI))

```shell
pnpm dev
```

### Stage Tamagotchi (Desktop Version)

```shell
pnpm dev:tamagotchi
```

A Nix package for Tamagotchi is included. To run airi with Nix, first make sure to enable flakes, then run:

```shell
nix run github:faxxxan/AIRI-AI
```

#### NixOS

Electron requires shared libraries that aren't in standard paths on NixOS. Use the FHS shell defined in `flake.nix`:

```shell
nix develop .#fhs
pnpm dev:tamagotchi
```

### Stage Pocket (Mobile Version)

Start the development server for the capacitor:

```shell
pnpm dev:pocket:ios --target <DEVICE_ID_OR_SIMULATOR_NAME>
# Or
CAPACITOR_DEVICE_ID_IOS=<DEVICE_ID_OR_SIMULATOR_NAME> pnpm dev:pocket:ios
```

You can see the list of available devices and simulators by running `pnpm exec cap run ios --list`.

If you need to connect server channel on pocket in wireless mode, you need to start tamagotchi as root:

```shell
sudo pnpm dev:tamagotchi
```

Then enable secure websocket in tamagotchi `settings/connections`.

### Documentation Site

```shell
pnpm dev:docs
```

### Publish

Run `bumpp` to update the monorepo version:

```shell
npx bumpp --no-commit --no-tag
```
